# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview

This project implements **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. PCA is a powerful technique used in data analysis and machine learning to extract relevant information by identifying **principal components** that explain the relationships between features in the data.

## Objectives

- Reduce the dimensionality of a given dataset.
- Retain as much variance as possible while minimizing information loss.
- Identify principal components that capture the most significant features.
- Visualize the transformed data in lower dimensions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations.
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** – for PCA implementation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for PCA should contain multiple features (dimensions). Ensure the dataset is cleaned and standardized before applying PCA.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Load the Dataset**  
   Import the dataset and inspect its structure.
   
2. **Preprocess the Data**  
   - Handle missing values.
   - Standardize the dataset (mean = 0, variance = 1).

3. **Apply PCA**  
   - Compute the covariance matrix.
   - Extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
   - Select the top principal components.

4. **Transform the Data**  
   - Project the dataset onto the selected principal components.

5. **Visualization & Analysis**  
   - Plot the explained variance ratio.
   - Scatter plot for lower-dimensional representation.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
